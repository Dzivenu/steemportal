# steemportal
A python2/Gtk+-3.0 based application for accesing and interacting with the Steem blockchain forum system

This project is just beginning and I am going to spend a lot of time working on it while I have the opportunity. There is a lot of work being done on the Steem blockchain system, but the main official web portal's web interface is heavy and slow especially with long comment threads. It also does not properly allow you to completely ignore the rubbish of trolls who contribute nothing but conflict and suffering upon other users.

These are the two goals of building this application. I am borrowing code from the piston project to make this happen, but because it uses a copyright licence, and I philosophically strenuously disagree with these licences, I am rewriting it, not deriving it. In my opinion while the developers and other significant contributors to the infrastructure of Steem certainly deserve to make a living, hey, even make good money off it, this is different to simply creating a means to access it. Sure, people can steal my work and claim it is their own but I pity the fool who tries to patent something stolen from the public domain. I dare them to, in fact, cos I'm pretty sure that someone will throw in some coins to help me smack them down and I'll certainly do my best to cover the cost in such an unlikely event.

When I have some amount of functionality, at minimum a working viewer to browse the blockchain's posts and statistics, I will be making a commit. For now, I will focus on making it happen.
