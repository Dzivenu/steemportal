# steemportal
A python2/Gtk+-3.0 based application for accesing and interacting with the Steem blockchain forum system

This project is just beginning and I am going to spend a lot of time working on it while I have the opportunity. There is a lot of work being done on the Steem blockchain system, but the main official web portal's web interface is heavy and slow especially with long comment threads. It also does not properly allow you to completely ignore the rubbish of trolls who contribute nothing but conflict and suffering upon other users.

When I have some amount of functionality, at minimum a working viewer to browse the blockchain's posts and statistics, I will be making a commit. For now, I will focus on making it happen.
