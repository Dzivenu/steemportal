# steemportal
A python2/Gtk+-3.0 based application for accesing and interacting with the
Steem blockchain forum system

This project is just beginning and I am going to spend a lot of time working
on it while I have the opportunity. There is a lot of work being done on the
Steem blockchain system, but the main official web portal's web interface is
heavy and slow especially with long comment threads. It also does not
properly allow you to completely ignore the rubbish of trolls who contribute
nothing but conflict and suffering upon other users.

These are the two goals of building this application. I am basing from code
from the piston project to make this happen, but because it uses a copyright
licence, and I philosophically strenuously disagree with these licences, I
am rewriting it, not deriving it. In fact I probably will use an entirely
different structure to the code that makes more sense to me.

In my opinion while the developers and other significant contributors to the
infrastructure of Steem certainly deserve to make a living, hey, even make
good money off it, this is different to simply creating a means to access it.
Not only that, but those who are working hard to make profit off it while
contributing nothing except acrimony and pain, a good interface that removes
their negative influence is good for the peace of mind of users, and thus,
good for Steem.

When I have some amount of functionality, at minimum a working viewer to
browse the blockchain's posts and statistics, I will be making a commit. For
now, I will focus on making it happen.
